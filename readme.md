# Thermomechanical Gradient Enhanced Damage UMAT
This repository contains a user material implementation for Abaqus (UMAT and UMATHT) for a thermo-mechanically coupled gradient-enhanced damage model. The framework can be adopted to several multi-field problems. 
A major benefit of the user material implementation (e.g. compared to a user element implementation) is the applicability of several integrated Abaqus features, such as contact algorithms, element formulations and solver structures. 

The implementation is provided by Lennart Sobisch (<lennart.sobisch@tu-dortmund.de>) and is documented in the publication  **Doi pending**.
If you publish results based on any of these models, please cite the relevant paper. If you are presenting results obtained with any of these models, please also mention this repository.

Each category contains (at least) three items:

    src: A folder containing the source code necessary to build the model
    doc: A folder containing documentation for the models
    ref.bib: Latex bibliography file with reference(s) to the appropriate paper(s)
