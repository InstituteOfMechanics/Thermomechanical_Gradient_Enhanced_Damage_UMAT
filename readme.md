# Thermomechanical Gradient Enhanced Damage UMAT
An Abaqus framework based on user materials (Umat and Umatht) for multi-field problems. 

A thermo-mechanically coupled gradient-enhanced damage model is implemented. The implementation framework can be adopted to several multi-field problems.

The implementation is based on the publication **insert Doi**.
